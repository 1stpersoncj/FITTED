# This application is an outfit library.  A digital closet if you will.  

# I noticed alot of people save their outfits in their Notes app, or photo gallery.  I wanted to make an app that allows users to save their outfits in one place, kind of like a digital closet. 

# This is the first application I will be building.  I have little experience coding.  At the start of this project, I have been doing the Scientific Computing course via Free Code Camp for the past few months, but that is all I know as of now.  Feel free to provide any assistance as it is very appreciated!
